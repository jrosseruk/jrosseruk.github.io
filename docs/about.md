# Hi I'm J!

I'm a DPhil student studying Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, with a proven track record in empirical AI Safety research and 3 years industry experience in engineering leadership.

I have collaborated with AISI and FLAIR previously, and my first author paper on the safety of Agentic Scaffolding was awarded an ICLR 2025 Oral Presentation at the SSI-FM workshop. As the founding Research Scientist at Convergence ($12M pre-seed, ex-Cohere founders, acq. Salesforce), I contributed to the first prototype of Proxy, a multi-modal web agent achieving SOTA performance with over 100k users. Previously I served as Principal ML Engineer at Pynea and Lead Software Engineer at Artera, delivering significant technical innovations while leading engineering teams.

My research interests include AI Safety, Interpretability, White-Box Control, Multi-Agent Systems and Geometric Deep Learning and I hold a fully-funded Membership to the London Initiative for Safe AI (LISA).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the Trumpet in my funk band, running friendly bouldering socials, as well as helping new climbers receive rope climbing certifications.
